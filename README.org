* Spacemacs Configuration

This is my personal configuration for Spacemacs. To get started:

- Install [[https://www.spacemacs.org][spacemacs]] by running the following commands. (You'll need to move
  =~/.emacs.d= to some new place if it already exists; spacemacs takes over this
  directory, and you instead configure =.spacemacs.d=.)

  #+begin_src bash
# Stash your old config, if existing
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.old

# prepare Spacemacs
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d

# this is a specific commit in the develop branch that I know is working.
# Alternatively, you could `git checkout develop`, which will probably work.
git checkout 761e2025aa37981af99e9eb4964a9de8de7c9023
  #+end_src

- Next, install this spacemacs configuration:

  #+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:sritchie/spacemacs.d.git ~/.spacemacs.d
  #+end_src

  Now open Emacs, watch a bunch of packages get installed and fix any errors you
  see.
